### Pablo Design Portfolio
## Bio
Pablo grew up in Richarson, Texas and is now attending MIT. As a prospective course 16 or course 22 student,
he is very interested in energy can be used to improve human habitations and transportation. Having grown up in
a state that is at hot as Texas, Pablo is very interested in how passive cooling and material sciences can
be used to minimize the energy consumption of households during the summer.

## Current Project
As a member of the _Introduction to Design and Rapid Prototyping_ class at MIT, Pablo is working with his peers to 
develop a method of capturing, or otherwise using energy from the environment. His primary interest would be testing
paints and materials that allow a scale model of a house to remain consistently cooler than its surroundings by employing barium
sulfate, grass on the ceilings, and evaporative cooling, but his plans remain flexible as he is yet to share these ideas with his classmates.
