### Pablo Design Portfolio
## Bio
Pablo grew up in Richarson, Texas and is now attending MIT. As a prospective course 16 or course 22 student,
he is very interested in energy can be used to improve human habitations and transportation. Having grown up in
a state that is at hot as Texas, Pablo is very interested in how passive cooling and material sciences can
be used to minimize the energy consumption of households during the summer.

## Current Project
As a member of the _Introduction to Design and Rapid Prototyping_ class at MIT, Pablo is working with his peers to 
develop a method of capturing, or otherwise using energy from the environment. His primary interest would be testing
paints and materials that allow a scale model of a house to remain consistently cooler than its surroundings by employing barium
sulfate, grass on the ceilings, and evaporative cooling, but his plans remain flexible as he is yet to share these ideas with his classmates.

###Current Brainstorm Ideas
-Compost Heater
-Light Up Platform
-Lord Kelvin's Thunderstorm
-Solar Air Compressor
-Cloud Chamber



## Car Design Projects
In High School, I dedicated much of my time to designing what I consider to be the best sportscar possible. Here are a few of the iterations
he has tried to work through, but this project is still active so there may be additions in the future. As seen in the following section, many aspects of the design are inspired by biology, although here I place particular focus on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems here.

## Human Anatomy
Inspired by the artists of the Renaissance, particularly, Leonardo da Vinci, I began a number of studies on the human form, some from
direct observation and others from Rodin statues.

## Car Illustrations
Besides trying to design a car to my own liking, I have also illustrated a number of cars that already exist, and have done work on comission, although it is not depicted here.

### Page Design
-Based on the Slate Design from the selection of themes on Github Pages found at the theme repository for [**slate**](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate)
