### Pablo Design Portfolio
## Bio
Pablo grew up in Richarson, Texas and is now attending MIT. As a prospective course 16 or course 22 student,
he is very interested in energy can be used to improve human habitations and transportation. Having grown up in
a state that is at hot as Texas, Pablo is very interested in how passive cooling and material sciences can
be used to minimize the energy consumption of households during the summer.

## Current Project
As a member of the _Introduction to Design and Rapid Prototyping_ class at MIT, Pablo is working with his peers to 
develop a method of capturing, or otherwise using energy from the environment. His primary interest would be testing
paints and materials that allow a scale model of a house to remain consistently cooler than its surroundings by employing barium
sulfate, grass on the ceilings, and evaporative cooling, but his plans remain flexible as he is yet to share these ideas with his classmates.

### Current Brainstorm Ideas
-Compost Heater
Here we see both a diagram and an actual instance of compost heaters being implemented. There is certainly potential for using leaves or food waste in a park to keep a space warmer than its surrounding environment during the winter, and the heat source itself can get as warm as 50 degrees celsius as seen [***here.***](http://compost.css.cornell.edu/physics.html)

-Light Up Platform
Using the simple idea of converting potential energy in people's steps, we can light up a small led array, particularly in a high traffic area.

-Lord Kelvin's Thunderstorm
As suggested by the name, this contraption was invented by the British scientist Lord Kelvin, all the way back in 1867 and has been used
to show the properties of charged particles and electric fields; however, to my knowledge it has never been used as an artistic installation
or using rain as its primary water source. The ideas would be to demonstrate how we can capture energy from unexpected sources, and would 
demonstrate the energy gathered in the form of a small spark that we can keep behind a small screen for safety (althoug the spark itself
would be no more harmful than one you might get after walking on a rug). Some of the basic information about these contraptions was found

-Solar Air Compressor
There are various ways we can harness the sun's heat to create a solar air compressor, ranging from efficient and simple to intricate and didactic. One of the options is to heat air in a channel and to harness it's expansion and desire to rise, thus driving a turbine. Another would be to heat the hot end of a stirling engine to turn the heat almost directly into rotary motion to drive a compressor. Both of these methods have low-scientific risk as the stirling engine and hot air balloon both date back to the Industrial Revolution or earlier.

-Cloud Chamber
Although CERN has their own [***guide***](https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/how-make-your-own-cloud-chamber) on how to create a cloud chamber, we do not need the same budget as they have to create a tool to explore and demonstrate the energy that constantly passes through us after travelling for millions, if not billions, of miles in outer space. As shown in the picture below, this device would allow for the viewer of the installation to see the paths of cosmic rays and other charged particles that may be in the environment, but would not need an external source of energy or radiation beyond that of the natural environment.

-Block energy storage



## Car Design Projects
In High School, I dedicated much of my time to designing what I consider to be the best sportscar possible. Here are a few of the iterations
he has tried to work through, but this project is still active so there may be additions in the future. As seen in the following section, many aspects of the design are inspired by biology, although here I place particular focus on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems here.

## Human Anatomy
Inspired by the artists of the Renaissance, particularly, Leonardo da Vinci, I began a number of studies on the human form, some from
direct observation and others from Rodin statues.

## Car Illustrations
Besides trying to design a car to my own liking, I have also illustrated a number of cars that already exist, and have done work on comission, although it is not depicted here.
